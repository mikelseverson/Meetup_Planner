Meetup Planner

This is my first project for the Udacity senior web developer course.

Here is the guidelines: 
"You will build a responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. The goal is to create an app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event."

This is in the process of being built with polymer and firebase for the database.
